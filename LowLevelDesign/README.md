# 🧠 Low-Level Design (LLD)

LLD focuses on **translating ideas into class diagrams**, **OOP principles**, and **designing modules** that are flexible, testable, and extendable.

In interviews, this is where you **draw class diagrams**, apply **SOLID principles**, and explain **design tradeoffs** — often under a ticking clock. This folder will prepare you to master that moment.

## ✅ Learning Goals

| Concept | Description | Status |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| [ ] OOP Concepts | Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism |
| [ ] SOLID Principles | Five golden design tenets of clean code |
| [ ] UML Class Diagrams | Modeling relationships: association, aggregation, composition |
| [ ] Design Patterns | Strategy, Factory, Observer, Singleton, Decorator, etc. |
| [ ] Interface vs Implementation | Coding to interfaces, not concrete classes |
| [ ] Dependency Injection | Loose coupling using DI containers |
| [ ] Composition over Inheritance | Favoring modular architecture |
| [ ] Immutability & Encapsulation | Writing predictable, side-effect-free modules |
| [ ] Reusability & Extensibility | Open-closed principle, plugin architecture |
| [ ] LLD Interview Framework | How to think, structure, and present design |
| [ ] Language-agnostic Thinking | Apply design in JavaScript or Java or any OOP language |
| [ ] Responsibility Assignment | SRP, cohesion, separation of concerns |
| [ ] Unit Testing & Mocking | Writing testable class methods |

## 💻 Practice Questions

Each of these requires a class diagram + implementation in JavaScript (Node.js preferred):

| Problem | Concepts Practiced |
|--------|---------------------|
| Design a Parking Lot System | OOP + State + Strategy Pattern |
| Design a Library System | Composition + Interface Segregation |
| Design an Elevator System | Observer + State Machines |
| Design a Splitwise Clone | Classes + Transactions + Polymorphism |
| Design Snake and Ladder Game | OOP + Rule Engine |
| Design Tic Tac Toe | Encapsulation + Grid State |
| Design ATM Machine | State + Strategy Pattern |
| Design Chess / Ludo | Composition, Interfaces, Turn-based flow |

## 🧪 Mini Projects

### 1. Class Design Portfolio
Pick any 3 from the list above and:
- Create class diagrams (draw.io, hand-drawn okay too)
- Write clean Node.js code (use ES6+ syntax)
- Add unit tests using `jest` or `mocha`
