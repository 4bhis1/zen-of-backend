# ‚ö° Caching Strategies & Implementation

When speed becomes the need, **caching** becomes the creed.

Caching allows you to **serve data faster**, reduce load on DBs, and improve system **resilience**. But caching carelessly? That‚Äôs how bugs and staleness sneak in. Let's learn to cache **intelligently**.

## ‚úÖ Learning Goals

| Topic | Description | Link |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| [ ] What is Caching? | Temporary storage for fast data access |
| [ ] Caching Layers | Browser, CDN, app layer, DB layer |
| [ ] Redis vs Memcached | In-memory storage for blazing speed |
| [ ] TTL (Time to Live) | Set cache expiry |
| [ ] Eviction Policies | LRU, LFU, FIFO, custom scoring |
| [ ] Cache Invalidation | The hardest problem in CS üòâ |
| [ ] Write-through vs Write-behind | Sync cache with DB or delay |
| [ ] Cache-aside Pattern | Lazy loading, manual population |
| [ ] CDN Caching | Static asset offloading |
| [ ] Query Caching | Caching DB queries (with Redis or inside DB) |
| [ ] Rate Limiting via Cache | Redis counter pattern |
| [ ] Session Management | Storing sessions in Redis |
| [ ] Redis Pub/Sub | Event broadcasting across instances |
| [ ] Distributed Caching | Horizontal scale-out caching |
| [ ] Caching in Microservices | Shared cache vs local cache dilemmas |

| Task | Core Concepts |
|------|---------------|
| Cache API responses using Redis | Redis, TTL, async Redis client |
| Implement Cache-aside Pattern | Manual fetch + store |
| Use Redis to rate-limit login | Key expiration, counter increment |

## üîß Mini Project: Redis-Cached Product API

- Build `/api/products?page=2`
- Data fetched from DB if not in Redis
- Store each page's response with TTL
- On product update ‚Üí invalidate page caches

## üß™ Mega Project: ZingCache Layer (Plug-in Cache for ZingTickets)

### Problem:
Your ticketing system experiences peak load during flash sales. The DB is overwhelmed.

### Solution:
Design and implement:
- Page-level caching of event listings (TTL: 5 mins)
- Seat availability cache (TTL: 10 sec)
- Lock seat selection for 1 min (auto-expiry Redis key)
- Event popularity ranking using sorted sets (ZSET)

Tech:
- Redis
- Node.js
- Middleware cache for REST API
- Async invalidation (manual or event-driven)
